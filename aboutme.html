            <p>I am the daughter of Sir Eluwa, from Imo state, Nigeria. I stay in Lagos and attended my lower education in Lagos. I recently graduated from the prestigious Afe Babalola University with a petroleum engineering degree. I am a very self-driven and passionate person. i also always consider the needs and wants to those important to me and I am an emotionally sympathetic person.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My decision to study petroleum engineering was my love for the oil and gas sector in Nigeria and worldwide. Being a recent graduate of this honorable course has made me understand better how countries that are oil producing or exporting function. I delved into the Reservoir Engineering and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) sector of the oil industry because of my inquisitiveness to really understand how crude oil A.K.A black gold is found, explored, extracted, and converted into things that we humans use everyday.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Personally, I love volunteering for organizations. In 2019, I volunteered and was elected to be the Treasurer of an organization called SPE ABUAD. SPE ABUAD is a sub of SPE Benin section which is a sub of SPE Nigeria Council which is also a sub of SPE International, one of the best or the best engineering and oil/gas organization in the world if I do say so myself. I went ahead to volunteer to be the Secretary General of SPE ABUAD in 2022 and these positions have thought me so much and have opened doors of opportunites for me. I currently volunteer for SPE Lagos section. As a Girl in STEM, Because of these, I was nominated to receive a Girl in STEM award given by SPE Nigeria Council.</p>
            <p>I prioritize God, myself, my mental health, my family and myself because these are of utmost importance to me.</p>
